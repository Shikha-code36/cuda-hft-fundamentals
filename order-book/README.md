# Order Book Implementation

This component implements a high-performance limit order book using CUDA and compares it with a traditional CPU-based implementation.

## Implementation Overview

The order book handles three primary operations:
- Adding limit orders (buy/sell)
- Canceling existing orders
- Matching orders when the market conditions allow

## Architecture

### Data Structures

- **Order**: Core structure containing order details (ID, type, price, quantity, timestamp)
- **CUDAOrderBook**: GPU-accelerated implementation using Thrust device vectors
- **CPUOrderBook**: Traditional implementation using STL containers

### Key Technical Approaches

#### CPU Implementation
- Uses `std::map` for price-time priority with `std::greater` comparator for buy orders
- Fast O(log n) lookup for best prices
- O(1) access to orders via ID through `std::unordered_map`

#### GPU Implementation
- Uses `thrust::device_vector` to store orders on the GPU
- Leverages parallel sorting for matching operations
- Maintains price-time priority through custom sorting predicates

## Performance Considerations

The GPU implementation shows performance advantages in specific scenarios:

1. **Large Order Volumes**: The GPU begins to outperform the CPU when processing >50,000 orders
2. **Batch Processing**: CUDA excels when multiple orders can be processed in parallel
3. **Sorting Efficiency**: Order matching benefits from Thrust's parallel sorting algorithms

## Design Decisions

### Memory Management
- GPU implementation carefully manages host-device transfers to minimize overhead
- Orders are kept in device memory to reduce PCIe bus traffic

### Price-Time Priority
Both implementations maintain the standard exchange rule of:
1. Better prices get higher priority
2. Equal prices are prioritized by timestamp (FIFO)

### Order Matching Algorithm
The matching engine follows standard exchange rules:
- Matches occur when bid price â‰¥ ask price
- Partial fills are supported
- Price-time priority is strictly enforced

## Performance Analysis

In benchmark tests:
- CPU processes ~380,000 orders/sec on a modern system
- GPU performance varies based on order complexity and batch size
- The GPU implementation shows increasing advantage as order volume grows

## Future Improvements

1. **Increased Parallelism**: The current implementation could exploit more parallelism in order insertion
2. **Memory Coalescing**: Further optimize GPU memory access patterns
3. **Atomic Operations**: Explore lock-free algorithms for concurrent order processing
4. **Multi-GPU Support**: Distribute the order book across multiple GPUs for extremely large markets
